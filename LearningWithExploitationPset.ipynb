        "In lecture, we stepped through multiple components of a loss function that is used to learn physics-based state representations. However, we do not use the loss function directly during learning, but rather the gradient of the loss function to perform gradient descent. In this problem, you will implement the gradient of each component of the loss function.\n",

These are the physical prior of the environment for this representation.\n",

        "First, we want our agent to learn state representations that follow the rule that F=ma. This means we need to implement the Proportionality Prior Gradient.\n",

        "\n",
        "We have implemented this for you to give you an example of how to implementing the remaining loss function components. We have broken the gradient into two components â€” an outer loop and an innter loop. The outer loop (executed in `proportionality_prior_gradient`) corresponds to the expectation portion of the function, where we want to find time steps where the agent took the same action. \n",
        "\n",
        "We then use a helper function, `proportional_loss_gradient`, to compute the gradient of $||\\triangle s_{t_2}|| - ||\\triangle s_{t_1}||)^2$. Now remember, to compute this gradient, it is useful to think of the function less in terms of the state representation themselves $s$, but rather in terms of the image vectors ($v_{t_1}, v_{t_1+1}, v_{t_2}, v_{t_2+1}$) and the mapping matrix ($m$). Which would give you:\n",
        "\n",
        "$\\frac{d}{dm} (||m v_{t_1 +1} - m v_{t_1}|| - ||m v_{t_2 +1} - m v_{t_2}||)^2$\n",
        "\n",
        "Which is important to think about when computing gradients because your gradients are always with respect to $m$, which is concealed inside the state representations. This derivative is computer below by iterating over each element of $m$ and computing the gradient of it with respect to the rest of the lost function, and then we return the entire gradient of $m$. \n",
        "\n",
        "You can see the gradient computation is grounded, not in the individual value of the state representations, but rather in the delta between state representations, and is focused on measuring the difference between those deltas. In implementing the gradients for the remaining functions, we hope you can refine your mathematical intuition behind the formulation of these loss function components "
