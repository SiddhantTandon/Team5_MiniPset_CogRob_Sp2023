# Team5_MiniPset_CogRob_Sp2023
Team 5 - Learning Models by Exploiting Structure and Fundamental Knowledge

##Overall Outline for Pset

* Coding problems
  * Step students through the implementation of the state representation loss function from lecture
  * Implement the gradients of the loss function components to demonstrate understanding of how the 
  loss functions relate to the actual data used in gradient descent
  * Loss function components to be implemented:
    * Temporal Cohesion
    * Proportionality Loss
    * Causality Loss
    * Repeatability Loss
  * Solutions are checked by comparing student responses to reference implementations of loss functions
* Analysis problems
  * One problem about state representation mapping
    * Students see visualization of the state representation learned with their loss functions
    * They are asked to identify indicators of successful learning to encourage them to think critically about what
    the state representation map truly signifies
    * Solutions are checked by comparison to a list of given indicators/if their answer makes sense on its own
